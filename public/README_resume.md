# Place your resume PDF here

Add a file named `resume.pdf` to this directory.

The download link on the About page points to `/resume.pdf` which will be served from this `public/` folder.

If you don't have a PDF resume yet, you can:
1. Export your resume from Google Docs, Microsoft Word, or Canva as PDF
2. Use a resume builder like Resumake, FlowCV, or RxResu.me
3. Generate one from your existing content using a LaTeX template

Once added, it will be automatically available for download on your portfolio site.
